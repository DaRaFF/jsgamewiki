#Welcome to the jsGameWiki!
This is the brain for game programming with html5/canvas/javascript. 

I'm trying to structure helpful sources like eBooks, videos, blogs, articles, presentations...


### Structure
Part I - Here is the stuff which is really relevant to game programming with html5/canvas/javascript

Part II - Here is the stuff which is related to webdevelopment and can be useful if you want to improve your basic skills


### Other Sources
First start point for good javascript resources is bebraw with his sensational [jswiki](https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki).

Actually I see jsGameWiki as an addition to jsWiki for game programming topics.

A second project I'm running is [webdevresources](https://github.com/DaRaFF/webdev-resources/). Here i'm collecting links for web development in general.
